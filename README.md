# Hello!
Over the course of 2022, I felt the lack of discipline in the way I approach programming and studying. 
This repo is a small tracker for my activity over the course of 2023, as a way to keep myself accountable.
If it helps anyone find some direction in their own projects, I'll be more than happy.

### January
1 - 5 : Finished up Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project. Deployed via github pages.
6 : Started FastAI's deep learning course. Finished the introduction and created a Kaggle account.
